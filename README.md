# Betterer Twitch Notifier
I wanted a software that notifies me when a streamer goes live. So I wrote it.\
This is still a **work-in-progress** software.

## To-Do's
- [x] Basic Functions
- [X] TUI
- [ ] GUI
- [X] Start on Login

## Operating Systems
- [X] Linux 
- [ ] macOS
- [ ] Windows

### Why are Windows and macOS not compatible rn? 
So... my plan is to support all major Operating Systems (Linux, Windows, MacOS), only Linux works at the moment.

- Windows has a bug (I hope it is a bug?) where it crashes when trying to load the image, bc Twitch gives 10 Bit ico files. Windows wants 8 bit Ico files. I will figure it out and provide you with an update that fixes that Issue.
- I don't have a Mac to really test it out on there, only a little Hackintosh Laptop. I will try to get it running there and give you a x86_64 macOS build.
